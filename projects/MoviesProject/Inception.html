              <p style="font-size:20px">Dom Cobb is a skilled thief, the absolute best
                in the dangerous art of extraction, stealing valuable secrets from deep
                within the subconscious during the dream state, when the mind is at its
                most vulnerable. Cobb's rare ability has made him a coveted player in
                this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made
                him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved.
                Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give
                him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible, inception.
                Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull
                off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea, but to plant one.
                If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of careful
                planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that
                seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have
                seen coming..</p>
