<p>Currently, I am an enthusiastic Compute Science student attending at
 John Jay college, working toward my degree. I have a great passionate about
 learning new skills and technologies. <br />I registered in this micro-credential
 program because I want to learn how to create a web page from scratch, also
 I believe this is agreat program for me to improve my programming skills and be
competitive and prepare for an internship. <br /r>So far we are using a text editor Atom
which is easy to read and understand and  I learned how to write some HTML tags such as
html, head, title, body, h 1-6, and p. </p>
